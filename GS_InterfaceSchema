The interface of the telemetry system between the embedded component
and the ground station is composed of a series of packets in ASCII
format. This decision was done to simplify the transfer through the XBEE
modules and for consistent handling of possible variations in 
integer/float format between the system components. 

The interface schema for the packet is in a fixed form, if one value
hasn't updated between successive packets it should be identical to 
the last one polled from the sensor.


Schema:

<> symbols are not to be sent, they are used as delimiter to describe
the value. e.g <xxx> means xxx will be sent.
For more details about their values in the embedded acquisition buffer
